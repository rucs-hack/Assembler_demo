<ul>
<li><b>Imhotep (~27th century BC)</b></li>

<div id="org15623fc" class="figure">
<p><img src="img/imhotep.jpg" alt="imhotep.jpg" />

</div>
<ul>
<li>Starting life as a member of the peasant class, Imhotep was so talented he
quickly rose through the ranks of Egyptian society to become the Egyptian
chancellor to the pharaoh Djoser.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>One of his greatest acheivements was beginning the period of stone pyramid
building, which he began by designing the first pyramid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser">Djoser's Step
Pyramid</a></li>

</ul>

<div id="org6ff5e3f" class="figure">

</div>
<ul>
<li>He was also the father of medicine, though originally western scholars largely
dismissed the Greeks own assertion that they learned so much from Egypt. Thus
while Hypocrites himself wrote that he owed much of his knowledge to Imhotep, this
was ignored by later western scholers.</li>

<h3 id="org5fee301"></h3>
<ul>
<li>After his death Imhotep came to be worshipped as a god in egypt, and was believed for
thousands of years to be responsible for the flow of the Nile river, science,
medicine and wisdom. The only non king to have this occur.</li>
<li>While so little is known in concrete terms of his personal life a lot can be inferred
from his achievements.</li>
<li>He was a superb mathematician and architect, able not only to duplicate
existing designs but create completely original ones which had never been
considered before.</li>
<li>As Chancellor he would have advised the Pharaoh, which means he would have
needed to be able to grasp the political, religious, and economic state of the
entire nation.</li>

<li>He was one of the most significant Physicians and Astronomers of the early
Islamic period, writing books on medicine which continued to be used for

<ul>
<li>A Muslim Andalusian polymath and jurist who wrote over a hundred books,
covering such varied subjects as philosophy, theology, medicine, astronomy,
physics, psychology, mathematics, Islamic jurisprudence and law, and
linguistics.</li>
<li>He also attempted to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with the Muslim world,

<ul>
<li>Considered by many to be father of the modern disciplines of historiography,
sociology and economics, Ibn Khaldun wrote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqaddimah">Muqaddimah</a>, what may be one of
the most analysed and influential pieces of Muslim sociological literature
ever written.</li>
<li>He has been proposed as being the originator of the scientific method,
although I know too little on this subject to comment on whether this would be
correct.</li>

</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Born into a family still living under the effects of an incomplete
emancipation process and suffering the frequent brutalities resulting from
this, Maya had a difficult early life, which led her into involvement with the
civil rights movement, and also into becoming a dancer, actor, poet and
writer.</li>
<li>She did too much to list here, but throughout her life she remained active in
politics and the civil rights movement, being awarded more than fifty
honorary degrees and serving on two presidential committees.</li>

<ul>
<li>Too often now the term <b>Polymath</b> is used to describe someone who has become
rich and hugely succesful. Mark Zuckerberg, for example is not a Polymath,
though he has been called one.</li>
<li>He's well educated, but this education was gained through his family being
wealthy. He may be a <b>famous dropout</b>, but he is because he had no need of the
degree certificate.</li>
<li>Had he not achieved his level of wealth and business success, which is
mostly by employing other people, he wouldn't even be considered.</li>
<li>This isn't how Polymathy works, that's how <b>business</b> works.</li>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgd63264b"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Being a Polymath doesn't mean you will become rich anyway, it means you
will be more likely to end up doing something you enjoy, or enriching the
lives of others.</li>
<li>This is <b>vastly</b> more important. Go watch a few speeches by <b>Jim Carrey</b> if
you don't want to take my word for it.</li>
<li>Can you <b>become</b> a Polymath? The simple answer to this is yes, but it, like
anything else worth doing, takes work.</li>
<li>Can you become another Imhotep or Ibn Khaldun? That's a different matter,
but you don't need to reach those heights to have a more satisfying career.</li>

<h3 id="org0d06337"></h3>
<ul>
<li>As stated at the beginning of this lecture, it literally means learning a
number of different subjects (and being able to apply them).</li>
<li>These can be aspects of computer science when you start out, there certainly
are a lot of aspects to pick up, and right now you know a few, but true
polymathy involves diverse fields, not just the ones you study at University
or in any formal setting.</li>
<li>In essence it means embracing a life where you'll never stop seeking new
experiences or things to learn, or ways to apply those things.</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgdf94501"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Also, Computing is a massive field, and we, as a field, are still at the start
of learning all the areas it can be applied to.</li>
<li>For example, pre <b>2000's</b>, no-one really thought there would be any money to be made in
social media.</li>
<li>Now it's a business worth billions, but no single person invented it. the idea
evolved over decades, until people started creating online services whose main
purpose was to collect data with the <b>side benefit</b> of allowing their service
users to communicate more easily.</li>
<li>However this has <b>always</b> been a side benefit, were it not these services
would not be free.</li>
<li>Supermarkets don't give away food to get you to use their cards, but they do
give rewards, because the data they collect is worth millions to them.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org43dcc40"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Back to the subject at hand, studying beyond your field is generally a good
idea. This is when ideas collide.</li>
<li>This usually gets easier once you've been working for a while, but to start
with it's a good idea to get into the habit of reading a wide range of non
fiction, and having a hobby or hobbies with unrelated to your main occupation.</li>
<li>With related work, Open Source work and eventually collaboration provides the
best opportunity for widening your knowledge and experience inside your field.</li>
<li>To start with, just learning different subjects, widening your knowledge
base, moving towards polymathy is the best idea.</li>

<h3 id="org0de3975"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Your employer, if you have one, might have courses on offer, so if they do,
take all that you can. These will, somewhat obviously, be related to your role</li>
<li>I'm suggesting studying outside completely beyond your field as well.</li>
<li>This needn't be on a formal course, since there are thousands of online
courses available which are relatively cheap.</li>
<li>Another cheap alternative is via the increasing number complete courses
universities are putting online, enabling you to study all the material, sans
support or qualification, for almost entire degree courses.</li>

<h3 id="orga03102f">The Garage Myth and Era of mega successful University Dropouts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Much is made of dropping out of University and starting out alone with nothing
but your own wits and a few resources.</li>
<li>Like they did in the olden days, when huge business were stated in garages.</li>
<li>So, how true is this, and can this <b>really</b> be done today?</li>
<li>Lets examine the <b>somewhat abbreviated</b> reality, by skipping over all but the
most famous examples I know of (not including people who sold their
companies).</li>

</ul>
</section>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org2b289a1"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bill Gates came from a rich family and was able to obtain large amounts of
money to begin his company. In addition he had been superbly educated prior to
'dropping out'.</li>
<li>Steve Jobs didn't have such a wealthy background, and did drop out, but he did
so because he didn't really need the degree certificate.</li>
<li>Some people simply don't, and he'd obtained what he needed from Reed College
by the time he left. While not a computer Scientist in the classical sense, he
was a smart businessman, but <b>still</b> not a Polymath.</li>
<li>Polymaths also tend to be Autodidacts for the most part. Maya Angelou was for
instance. An Autodidact teaches themselves and is sometimes actively held back
by conventional education.</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orge43ff98"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dropout now with the industry so focussed on degree qualifications, (including
Apple,Google, Microsoft and Facebook) and you'd possibly be unemployable, at
least in Computing, but this was a long time ago, and Jobs founded Apple with
Steve Wozniak with, as many overlook a <b>lot</b> of investment capital while still
in his garage, after only a short period of working without funding.</li>
<li>Google may have been based initially in a garage, but Larry Page and Sergey
Brin, its founders were both graduates of Stanford University. This is one of
the most expensive universities in America to enter, and getting there
requires an equally expensive prior education.</li>
<li>In short neither Google founder were from poor backgrounds, they both had a
serious advantage to begin with, and again lots of investment funding.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org8fba00f"></h3>
<ul>
<li>All of these examples were people who had well rounded educations. Not
Polymaths, but decently educated to the point of being able to use the money
they had well.</li>
<li>They were great examples of good people who were good at <b>Business</b>, but since
they mostly had a huge financial advantage, went looking for another label and
chose <b>Polymath</b> instead.</li>
<li>A true Polymath can succeed <b>without</b> much money. They are taken on and given
positions of power <b>because</b> they are polymaths, not the other way round.</li>
<li>Does this mean it's impossible to reach such heights in the world of computing
without having such a prior advantage?</li>

<ul>
<li>It means it's more difficult, certainly, but this is the case in every
field. However technology is changing. No one person or corporation can
predict what will be the next big thing.</li>
<li>This means the floor is open for someone to <b>really</b> experiment, bring
together existing technologies in different ways and discover something new.</li>

<h3 id="org216d67c">From Prince of Persia to Movie Motion Capture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created in 1989 by <b>Jordan Mechner</b>, this game, produced by one boy with the
assistance of his brother it would be fair to say changed the way games and
movies were made forever.</li>
<li>It would also be fair to say it did so only because Jordan wanted smoother
animations in his game, not because he set out deliberately to change the industry.</li>

</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>He filmed his brother performing all of the movement scenes in his games
(fighting/jumping, climbing), then transcribed them into his game.</li>
<li>Mechner had skills beyond programming in order to achieve this. <b>Design</b>,
<b>planning</b>, <b>film-making</b>, <b>drawing (painting?)</b>.</li>
<li>The game franchise he created is famous, he's succesful, but as he hasn't
achieved the <b>'American Standard For Success (TM)'</b> level of wealth, therefore
no-one calls him a polymath, although he certainly is.</li>

<ul>
<li>His early work has now evolved into the motion capture technology we are
familiar with today, and he is acknowledged as the person who began it.</li>
<li>I can't reproduce a chronology for it, but now rather than drawing over live
actors, reference points are sometimes (but not always) placed on the actors
bodies to be used by CGI modellers later.</li>

<h3 id="org5cf4b20">Relating all this to Open Source</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modern workplaces tend to channel you into specialising on whatever is they
happen to be paying you for.</li>
<li>They may feel justified for this, after all, it's their money, and you have
agreed to work for them.</li>
<li>But long term, thinking like this hurts your prospects. Learning one thing in
depth for a company will do you no good if you then leave that company and
this skill isn't required elsewhere.</li>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org52bba3e"></h3>
<ul>
<li>There have been three major economic crashes in the last two
decades. Specialisation can be a risky strategy in such a financially unsteady
job market</li>
<li>Keeping an Open Source portfolio active, either by having your
own projects, or by participating in a variety of different types ones run by
other people or groups (for preference ones outside of your 'comfort zone'),
you can keep expanding your knowledge.</li>
